# C++

The thought behind of this repository is try some C++ concepts which are used on regular basis in Automotive
Embedded function development, Design patterns, google unit tests and SOLID principles of coding.

In order to fullfil this purpose there are three sub directories

1. C++
2. Design Patterns
3. Solid Principles
4. Google unit tests

Every sub directory has its own Cmake list and a make CMakeList is present to execute all subdirectories. 
In order to build the repository, you could do the following:

For eg:
1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
