# C++

The thought behind this repository is try some C++ concepts  Design patterns, google unit tests and SOLID principles of coding 
which are used on regular basis for C++ embedded function development.

In order to fullfil this purpose there are four sub directories

1. C++
2. Design Patterns
3. Solid Principles
4. Google unit tests

Every sub directory has its own Cmake list and a common CMakeList is present to execute all subdirectories. 
In order to build the repository, you could do the following:

For eg:
1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
