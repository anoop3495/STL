# C++

The thought behind of this repository is try some C++ concepts which are used on regular basics in Automotive
Embedded function development, Design patterns and SOLID principles of coding.

In order to fullfil this purpose there are three sub directories

1. C++
2. Design Patterns
3. Solid Principles

Every sub directory has its own Cmake list, you could do the following:

For eg:

1. cd DesignPatterns
2. mkdir build
3. cd build
4. cmake ..
5. make
